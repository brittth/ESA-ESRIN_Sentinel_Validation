# ESA-ESRIN_Sentinel_Validation

This repository contains the code of the validation of Sentinel-2 and 3 optical products conducted during my Young Graduate Trainee program at ESA-ESRIN. It was published with permission from my supervisor.

The scripts folder contains the R code and relevant input. The sentinel_data and reference_data folders each contain a list of required files, not uploaded due to their size.

The Sentinel_Validation_presentation folder contains the Latex code to create a presentation with all methods, validation results and their cross validation results. It requires the images exported by the R code for the Sentinel validation. Path names loading the imagery may have to be adjusted to make the Latex code function. The presentation in pdf format is not uploaded due to its size.
